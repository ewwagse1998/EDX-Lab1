Course Questions:
1.  I designed this project the way I did because I am new to JavaScript and Node JS.  I decided to write my own converter function while still incorporating NPM modules to beautify the output instead of a single line.  I also created a untilities file so I could use the import/export logic learned in the class.  Since I am fairly new to JavaScript I ran into issues trying to return values from internal functions.  I also struggled with understanding which File System class to use.  I was using CreateReadStream at first but then ran into issues with the size of the file.  
2.  I tested my project placing the customer-data.csv file in my project folder and running the CSVtoJSONConvert file from command line.  I also tried files in different folders with different names.  
3.  The program seems to work but since I am so new to JavaScript I am sure there are many things I could have done better.
